3. Course Registration: Students can view available courses, check prerequisites, and register for courses based on their interests and eligibility.

4. User Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, view their enrolled courses, and check the course schedule.

5. Notifications and Alerts: The system may send notifications for enrollment deadlines, course updates, and other important events.

6. Database Integration: The project integrates with a database to store user data, course information, and enrollment records securely.
