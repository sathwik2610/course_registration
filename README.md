Brief description of projects:

1. Course registration portal:
  The course registration portal is a web-based application that enables students to register for courses and allows administrators to manage course offerings. It includes user authentication, course management, enrollment features, and a user-friendly interface. The system ensures secure data handling and provides notifications for important updates, enhancing the overall registration experience.

2. Air canvas using OpenCV and Mediapipe
   The AirCanvas project utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe to create a virtual drawing tool that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures. By tracking hand movements with computer vision techniques, it detects fingertip positions and translates them into drawing actions on the screen. This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and interactive graphics, enabling a unique hands-free drawing experience.
